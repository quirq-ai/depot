"""Fetch pinned toolchains and dependencies into a content-addressed store, checked by digest.

A pin (quirq-repo/1) is a source and a digest. The source's scheme picks the fetcher:

    https://..., file://...        an artifact; its bytes must hash to the sha256 digest
    oci://REGISTRY/REPO@MANIFEST   an artifact layer in an OCI registry (the toolchains repo
                                   publishes here); the source must name the image manifest
                                   (qqsync refuses one that does not) and the sha256 digest
                                   names the layer blob in it
    any git URL + git:<commit>     a source tree at that commit

Each pin is fetched once per machine into $QQ_HOME/store/<algo>-<hex>, unpacked when it is a
tarball, and never changed after: the entry is made read only, its tree (paths, kinds, sizes,
times, link targets) is recorded in TREE_RECORD inside it, and every reuse checks the tree
again, so a toolchain something wrote into (a build, a package manager) is refused instead of
shared. Remove a refused entry with
`chmod -R u+w ENTRY && rm -rf ENTRY`; the next qq sync fetches it again.

Pins are resolved, fetched (https, file, oci) and verified (every scheme, git checkouts included)
by qqsync.pins, so depot only adds the git checkout and unpacking.
A half-fetched entry is never visible: it is built in a scratch directory and renamed into place.
TODO(expert): the record sits beside the tree it describes, so it catches accidents and stray
writes, not someone who rewrites both with the user's own rights.
